                <h3>About Heart Health</h3>
                Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States. Coronary artery disease (CAD) 
                is the most common type of heart disease. 
                According to the CDC, every year, approximately 805,000 people  
                have a heart attack and 659,000 people die from heart disease in the United States. However, around <b>1 in 5 heart attacks are silent.</b>

                <h3>Keeping Track of Heart Health</h3>
                Common symptoms of a heart attack include chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure, and shortness of breath. However, symptoms are not
                always so clear. A more reliable way to monitor heart health is through measuring heart rate. If there are detected 
                irregularities in heart rate, it may be a sign of concern. This web portal allows patients and physicians to <b>keep track of
                health reports by monitoring heart rate. </b>
            </div>
            
            <div class="p3">
                <h3>How the Platform Works</h3>
                The portal utilizes a platform that analyzes ECG acquired from single lead devices.
                The most common single lead devices are Apple watch (ECG enabled), Fitbit Sense, etc. 
                The platform is device agnostic. 
                Unlike many of the device providers, the platform diagnoses several types of arrhythmia conditions. 
                The reports generated using Artificial Intelligence are accessible to general physicians and specialists.
                The platform also connects patients with specialists for consultation.
